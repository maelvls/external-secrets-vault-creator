[slides]: https://slides.com/maelvls/hack-your-kubernetes-controller-in-10-minutes "Slides of the presentation 'Hack your Kubernetes controller in Bash in 10 minutes!'"

On 30 June 2022, Antoine Le Squ√©ren and Ma√´l Valais presented "Hack your
Kubernetes controller in Bash in 10 minutes!" at Kubernetetes Community
Days Berlin. The rest of this document shows how to run the "one-liner
controller" we talked about in the presentation.

## Try the one-liner controller for yourself (`controller.sh`)

In the presentation, we show a controller that takes for form of a
"one-liner" that you can copy-paste in your terminal.

```sh
kubectl get externalsecret --watch -ojson \
  | jq 'select(.status.conditions[]?.reason == "SecretSyncedError")' --unbuffered \
  | jq '.spec.data[0].remoteRef | "\(.key) \(.property)"' -r --unbuffered \
  | while read key property; do
    vault kv put $key $property=somerandomvalue
  done
```

The file `controller.sh` contains the above command.

To try this controller, you will need to install the following tools:

- `docker` which you can get with [`colima`](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)
  on M1 and Intel Macs (instead of Docker Desktop for Mac).
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) 1.24 or above (required for `--subresource`),
- [`k3d`](https://k3d.io/v5.4.3/#installation).

Then, run the following command. The command creates a K3s cluster
and installs Vault and external-secrets, as well as an ExternalSecret
object called `postgres` for demonstration purposes:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

Run the following long-running command (this is an optional step):

```console
$ kubectl get externalsecret --watch
NAME       KEY                     PROPERTY   READY   REASON         MESSAGE
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   True    SecretSynced   Secret was synced
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   True    SecretSynced   Secret was synced
```

Open a second shell session to create a tunnel to Vault with
the following command:

```console
kubectl port-forward -n vault vault-0 8200
```

In a third shell session, run the controller with the command:

```sh
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200 VAULT_TOKEN=root
./controller.sh
```

Looking at the first shell session (the one with `kubectl get externalsecret --watch`)
you will see the `postgres` external secret going from `SecretSyncedError` to
`SecretSynced`:

```text
NAME       KEY                     PROPERTY   READY   REASON             MESSAGE
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   False   SecretSyncedError  could not get secret data from provider
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   True    SecretSynced       Secret was synced
```

The controller's output isn't great. It just shows what `vault put` shows
when an external secret is processed.

```console
$ ./controller.sh
======= Secret Path =======
secret/data/dev-1/postgres

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-27T15:41:59.346502796Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1
```

(Optional) You can now run the controller in a Pod. Run the following
two commands to build the container and

```sh
docker buildx build . -t controller:local -o type=docker,dest=img.tar && k3d images import img.tar
kubectl apply -f ./deploy.yaml
```

> **‚ÅâÔ∏è `docker build` vs. `docker buildx build`**: In the above command, we use the
> `buildx` subcommand, also called BuildKit. Unlike the traditional `docker build`
> command, with BuildKit, it is possible to save the Docker-compatible image tarball
> directly to disk using `-o type=docker,dest=img.tar`.

Check that the controller is running:

```console
$ kubectl logs -f deployment/controller
======= Secret Path =======
secret/data/dev-1/postgres

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-27T15:41:59.346502796Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            2
```

To see if the controller is working, you can run the following command:

```sh
vault kv metadata delete secret/dev-1/postgres
```

In the first shell session where `kubectl get externalsecret --watch` is running,
you will see the external secret from `SecretSynced` to `SecretSyncedError`
and back to `SecretSyncedError`:

```text
NAME       KEY                     PROPERTY   READY   REASON             MESSAGE
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   False   SecretSyncedError  could not get secret data from provider
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   True    SecretSynced       Secret was synced
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   True    SecretSynced       Secret was synced
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   True    SecretSynced       Secret was synced
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   False   SecretSyncedError  could not get secret data from provider
postgres   secret/dev-1/postgres   password   True    SecretSynced       Secret was synced
```

## Go further: try the advanced Bash controller (`controller-with-conditions.sh`)

As we demonstrated during the presentation, one-liner `controller.sh` has a
very uninformative logs.

On top of poor logs, `controller.sh` does not inform Kubernetes users why a
particular ExternalSecret object does not seem to be picked up by the
controller. Nothing shows in the status, and nothing shows in events.

The file `controller-with-conditions.sh` is similar to `controller.sh`, except
for three aspects:

1. The user is now alerted of problems with the condition `Created`.
2. The user now has to set the annotation `create: true` to enable the
   auto-generation of the secret in Vault.
3. The logs are now well structured.

In a first shell session, turn on port-forwarding to Vault with the command:

```console
kubectl port-forward -n vault vault-0 8200
```

In a second shell session, run the controller with the command:

```sh
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200 VAULT_TOKEN=root
./controller-with-conditions.sh
```

You can now "enable" the behavior on the external secret `postgres` with the
following command:

```sh
kubectl annotate externalsecret postgres create=true
```

The logs should look like this:

```console
$ ./controller-with-conditions.sh
info: started watching ExternalSecrets.
postgres: the ExternalSecret is Ready=False, let us create a random password and put it in Vault.
postgres: the Vault secret was created.
postgres: inconsistency: Created is True but SecretSyncedError is False. Attempting to recreate the secret in Vault to fix this issue.
postgres: the ExternalSecret is Ready=False, let us create a random password and put it in Vault.
postgres: the Vault secret was created.
```
